distribution the Makefiles can be prepared using the configure
command,

  ./configure

You can then build the library by typing,

  make


The library can be installed using the command,

  make install

The default install directory prefix is /usr/local.  Consult the file
INSTALL for information on installing the library in another location
or changing other default compilation options.
